# TINDER-Swiping-Bot
</br>
DESCRIPTION:</br>
</br>
- This is a Tinder Swiping Bot developed using Selenium with Python.</br>
- This bot doesn't log in using google account as google doesn't allow automated login.</br>
- It uses an already active session to log in and then swipes left continuously.</br>
- Although, the bot only swipes left so that no hearts are broken but can also be configured to swipe right with a little modification.</br>
</br>
STEPS TO SKIP AUTOLOGIN: </br>

- Manually login to tinder using google/Facebook.</br>
- Launch google chrome using your default chrome profile. (You can read more about this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31062789/how-to-load-default-profile-in-chrome-using-python-selenium-webdriver">here</a>.)</br>
- This will skip your login.</br>
- Here's my code for it.</br>
